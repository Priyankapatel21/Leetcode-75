## 📌 About the Study Plan

LeetCode 75 is a guided path for practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms**, covering core topics in a progressive manner. It is divided into three sections:

1. **Level 1: 1 - 2 weeks** – Fundamentals (arrays, strings, prefix sums)
2. **Level 2: 2 - 3 weeks** – Intermediate (two pointers, sliding window, trees)
3. **Level 3 (optional)** – Advanced (graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Trees
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Programming
